This section is for people who have never played beatmania.

In this section, you'll learn the basics of the various selection screens, and how to play a song.

Even as someone that's familiar with other rhythm games, or if you're completely fresh to them, there's a few things that are worth knowing about the game before you get fully started. There's plenty more to know, but teaching the basics comes first.

Once you've played a decent amount of songs and have familiarized yourself with the game, go onto the Beginner section to learn some more basic information.

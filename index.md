# The 5key Guidebook

A guide inspired by [iidx.org](https://iidx.org), made for beatmania -- no, not IIDX, the *original* beatmania, for players of all skill level.

This guide is meant to offer basic information & advanced knowledge about one of KONAMI's older works, without being too confusing and all in one organized place.

Most basic arcade information will be based on **beatmania THE FINAL**, the final version in the game's series; however, other more detailed information will refer to other games in the series as well.

Pick an item from the menu to continue reading.

# The 5key Guidebook

An attempt at making a comprehensive guide of '5key' beatmania, aka what came before IIDX, made using [just-the-docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs).

Mostly inspired by [iidx.org](https://iidx.org), which is a great project you should also go check out.

## To-do

- Finish up the beginner section (Tips section, mainly)
- Intermediate section (talk about the game's jank per-song timing windows, weird scroll speed multipliers, and scoring)
- Advanced section (bor-per plays, EXPERT+, maybe another thing to throw here?)
- Double section (UGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH)
- Compendium section (different game modes, all the unlock codes (and maybe modifier codes, could put those on a different page), more detailed score calculations, other misc. stuff)
- Arcade hardware section (definitely get people more knowledgable than me to help with this)
- Terminology section (seek through the list on KANI KANI CRAB -- maybe get some help with translation)
- External resources section (definitely link KANI KANI CRAB's various sources, and remywiki's -- seek through the 5key discord link sheet for other information)
- More...?

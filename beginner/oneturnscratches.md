## What are 1-Turn Scratches?

You may have seen the above animation before you entered the mode select screen.

While mostly contained in songs/charts that were made for 7thMIX & THE FINAL only, thus being very unrepresented in most charts, they are still a present mechanic, and are worth knowing to score well.

A 1-Turn scratch simply requires you to rotate the turntable in a full, single spin, before the note ends. There is no timing for when to start or stop spinning; you must simply rotate the turntable to around 360 degrees before it runs out.

Depending on how far you've turned it, you will receive a different judgement for doing so, with the best judgement being rewarded for being as close as possible to 360 degrees.

- Turning it by less than or equal to around 165 degrees results in a Poor.
- Turning it by around 170-250 degrees results in an early Good.
- Turning it by around 255-310 degrees results in an early Great.
- Turning it by around 315-365 degrees, or more ideally, 360 degrees, results in a flashing Great.
- Turning it by around 370-425 degrees results in a late Great.
- Turning it by any more than around 430 degrees will always result in a late Good.
  - It is impossible to earn a Bad on a 1-Turn Scratch.

The following image shows a more accurate view of what the range of judgement is, alongside equivalent in-game values for turntable rotation.
